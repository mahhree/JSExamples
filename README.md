Simple JavaScript Tasks and Examples

BasicFunctions: 
  - Includes 8 functions 
      - The findMin function accepts one argument which is a JavaScript array of mixed data type and returns a number.
           The findMin argument is able to find and return the minimum numeric value in the array. Do NOT use Math.max() or Math.min() in your solution.
      - The halfNumberToArray function accepts one argument which is number and returns an array. The halfNumberToArray function should take the number and divide that number into two integers. If the number is even then both integers in the array are the same. If the number is odd then the first integer should be the higher integer and the second should be the lower. The array should never contain a float. Do NOT use array access to add/remove in the array (DO NOT USE: array[0] = n).
