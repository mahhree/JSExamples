Simple JavaScript Tasks and Examples

BasicFunctions: 
  - Includes 8 functions 
      - 1: The findMin function accepts one argument which is a JavaScript array of mixed data type and returns a number.
           The findMin argument is able to find and return the minimum numeric value in the array. Do NOT use Math.max() or Math.min() in your solution.
      - 2: The halfNumberToArray function accepts one argument which is number and returns an array. The halfNumberToArray function should take the number and divide that number into two integers. If the number is even then both integers in the array are the same. If the number is odd then the first integer should be the higher integer and the second should be the lower. The array should never contain a float. Do NOT use array access to add/remove in the array (DO NOT USE: array[0] = n).
      - 3: The countCharacters accepts two argument which is a character and a string and returns a number. The countCharacters function will find and count the number of time the character appears in the given string. The count should be case in-sensitive.
      - 4: The findAndReplace function accepts three argument which are all strings and the function returns a string. The findAndReplace function uses the first argument to find a character in the given string phrase and replace it with the character given as the second argument. It then returns the string phrase with the character properly replaced. The replace should be case sensitive.
      - 5: The removeFalsey function accepts one argument which is an array and the function returns an array. The removeFalsey function will return an array where all the values which evaluate to false are not present. Only values which are NOT false will be in the array. Do NOT use array access to add/remove in the array (DO NOT USE: array[0] = n).
